# TongVMoe: AI-Powered Tongue Diagnosis for Liver Fibrosis


This study provides a convenient, noninvasive solution for early detection and dynamic monitoring of liver fibrosis through Chinese medicine tongue diagnosis. **Code will be published upon article acceptance.**

## 🎯 Overview

TongVMoe is an AI-powered diagnostic system that modernizes Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis for liver fibrosis screening. By combining ancient medical wisdom with cutting-edge deep learning, we create an objective, interpretable, and accessible diagnostic tool.

### What We Built ⚗️

- **🧬 Interpretable AI Model**: Multi-task learning framework that simultaneously identifies liver fibrosis and tongue features
- **☯️ TCM-AI Integration**: Bridges traditional Chinese medicine principles with modern computer vision
- **🩺 Non-invasive Screening**: Alternative to expensive imaging and invasive liver biopsy
- **🎖️ Clinical Validation**: Extensive clinical testing and validation by senior TCM physicians

## 🏗️ Technical Innovation

### Tongue-MMoE Architecture 🎛️

- **🌌 VMamba Backbone**: Advanced visual feature extraction for tongue image analysis
- **🎯 Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts**: Handles multiple diagnostic tasks simultaneously
- **🔮 Explainable AI**: Provides visual interpretations of diagnostic decisions
- **⚙️ Multi-task Learning**: Joint optimization of liver fibrosis detection and tongue feature recognition

### Tongue Feature Analysis 👁️‍🗨️

Our system identifies seven key tongue characteristics according to TCM theory:

- 🎨 Tongue color, cracks, coating properties,Tooth marks, petechiae, and other diagnostic indicators
- 🧬 Each feature provides insights into different aspects of liver health
- 🧪 Discovered significant association between tongue petechiae and liver fibrosis
- 👨‍⚕️  Annotations by TCM physician with 20+ years experience
